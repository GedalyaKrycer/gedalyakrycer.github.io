# 02-homework-bootstrap-responsive-portfolio
In this project I created a 3 page responsive portfolio website. It is built on the Bootstrap 4 framework and then further modified with custom CSS. 

## Highlights From Project
* Navbar designates the "active" link for each page and includes the `sr-only` class for link. This is to help people understand what page they are on, from both a UX and accessibility standpoint. 

* Made the navigation fixed, so it stays in position when scrolling.

* On mobile gave the image a shadow for stylistic purposes. It also centers on the page and no longer floats the text around it.

* Added a meta description for SEO benefits and for Google to grab and display on the SERP page.

* Where possible I tried to stay away from using element selectors and instead using classes. (Except for items like `<h1>` and `<body>` and other such base elements) 

* Brought in custom fonts from Google Fonts

* Pinned the footer to the bottom of the screen

* Added Font Awesome icons for social media 

* On the portfolio page's thumbnail I added an overlay hoverstate that contains additional text and link's to my external portfolio. (These hide on mobile)
