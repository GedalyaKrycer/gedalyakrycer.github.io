                            I am a Vegas-based front-end developer and creative. I obsess over the details and love learning new technologies. (I also obsess over movies and love everything from superhero blockbusters to romcoms.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I recently left my agency job as a Digital Design Director to follow my true passionâ€”building websites from the ground up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am attending the University of Arizona's Coding Bootcamp, for certification in Full Stack Development.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With this deeper understanding of how to build quality sites, I look forward to changing careers to web development, built on a strong design foundation.
