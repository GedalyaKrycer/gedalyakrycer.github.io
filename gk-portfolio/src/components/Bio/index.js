                            Hi there! I am a Vegas-based front-end developer and creative, who obsesses over the details and loves learning new technologies. 
                            
                        </p>
                         <p>   
                            (I also obsess over movies and enjoy everything from superhero blockbusters to romcoms.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                I recently left my agency job as a Digital Design Director to follow my true passionâ€”building websites from the ground up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                In September of 2020, I earned a certification in Full Stack Development, from the University of Arizona's 6 month coding bootcamp. It's a joy to not only design a great site, but code it into reality as well.
                        </p>

                         <p>
                                With this deeper understanding of how to build quality sites, I look forward to changing careers to web development, built on a strong design foundation.
                        </p>
